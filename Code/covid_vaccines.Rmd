# R Setup and Required Packages
In this project, the open-source R programming language is used to model the progression in the COVID-19 pandemic in different U.S. counties. R is maintained by an international team of developers who make the language available at [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/). Readers interested in reusing our code and reproducing our results should have R installed locally on their machines. R can be installed on a number of different operating systems (see [Windows](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/), [Mac](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/), and [Linux](https://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/) for the installation instructions for these systems). We also recommend using the RStudio interface for R. The reader can [download RStudio](http://www.rstudio.com/ide) for free by following the instructions at the link. For non-R users, we recommend the [Hands-on Programming with R](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/packages.html) for a brief overview of the software's functionality. Hereafter, we assume that the reader has an introductory understanding of the R programming language.

In the code chunk below, we load the packages used to support our analysis. Note that the code of this and any of the code chunks can be hidden by clicking on the 'Hide' button to facilitate the navigation. **The reader can hide all code and/or download the Rmd file associated with this document by clicking on the Code button on the top right corner of this document.** Our input and output files can also be accessed/ downloaded from [fmegahed/vaccines](https://github.com/fmegahed/vaccines).


```{r packages, cache=FALSE}
# Check and install if these packages are not found locally on machine
if(require(pacman)==FALSE) install.packages("pacman")
if(require(devtools)==FALSE) install.packages("devtools")
if(require(urbnmapr)==FALSE) devtools::install_github('UrbanInstitute/urbnmapr')

pacman::p_load(tidyverse, magrittr, janitor, lubridate, hms, skimr, # data analysis packages
               DT, pander, stargazer, knitr, # for nicely printed outputs
               scales, DataExplorer, plotly, # for plots

# The Vaccination Dataset

## Extracting the Dataset

The CDC has made available a dataset for [COVID-19 Vaccinations in the United States by County](https://data.cdc.gov/Vaccinations/COVID-19-Vaccinations-in-the-United-States-County/8xkx-amqh). Per the link's description, the dataset captures:  

> Overall US COVID-19 Vaccine administration data at county level. Data represents all vaccine partners including jurisdictional partner clinics, retail pharmacies, long-term care facilities, dialysis centers, Federal Emergency Management Agency and Health Resources and Services Administration partner sites, and federal entity facilities. 


We extracted the data using the code chunk below.

```{r vaccinesRaw, results='asis'}
csvLink = "https://data.cdc.gov/api/views/8xkx-amqh/rows.csv?accessType=DOWNLOAD"
rawVaccinesData = read_csv(csvLink)

vacCSVtime = Sys.time()

vaccines = rawVaccinesData %>% 
  # Removing unknown (UNK) and territories/states outside of continental US
  filter(!Recip_State %in% c('AK', 'AS', 'FM', 'GU', 'HI', 
                             'MH', 'MP', 'PR', 'PW', 'UNK', 'VI')) %>% 
  # Converting Date from Char to Date format
  mutate(Date = mdy(Date)) %>% 
  # Ascending order by FIPS and Date
  arrange(FIPS, Date) %>% 
  # Reducing the columns to those potentially relevant
  select(Date, FIPS, MMWR_week, Recip_County, Recip_State,
         Series_Complete_Pop_Pct, Completeness_pct) %>% 
  # Converting Char to Factor cols  
  mutate_if(is.character, as_factor)

# Explicitly saving the vaccines df
write_rds(vaccines, "../Data/vaccines.rds")

# Rounding the time of data extraction to nearest minute
paste0('The vaccines data were extracted on ',  
      format(vacCSVtime, '%B %d, %Y'), 
      ' at approximately ',
     round_hms(as_hms(vacCSVtime), digits = -2), '.')
```
